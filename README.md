# MCDealer2
Complete rework of [MCDealer](https://github.com/CptGummiball/MC-Dealer) (WebUI for [villagermarket](https://github.com/Bestem0r/VillagerMarket))

This is the repo for MCDealer2 the complete rework of MCDealer.

Since we had some problems with the old version, we rolled out the whole project again and completely revised the code. It's not 100% finished yet.

More information and the code itself will follow in a few days.

But here's a little insight into the changes:

- Faster processing of shop data
- pure Java code and no more Python
- NBT data is now completely read out and converted so that it can be used perfectly by the webUI
- the UI remains unchanged for now
- a more stable web server is used
- ssh for external web servers
- no limits regarding compatibility with other plugins
- better interaction with villagers ingame
- the link command now reads the correct IP
- more options in the config.yml to customize the webUI
